                With the season-by-season comparer, you can pick any two players in NBA history 
                (1950-2021) and view all their season statistics for their careers. You can compare 
                any two seasons for any two players and view normal statistics or advanced statistics, 
                with checkmarks next to the player with the better statistic.

                To better compare players from different time periods, the adjusted statistics comparer 
                standardizes each player's season statistics based on the year's averages and then rescales
                based on 2020 statistics, so now you can compare any two players as if they played together in 2020.
